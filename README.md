# Bookmark Manager

This is the repository for my week four challenge at [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com). This week involved learning about databases. Some of the technologies utilised included Sinatra, DataMapper, PostgreSQL, BCrypt etc. to enable us to make a functioning bookmark manager that we deployed with Heroku.
